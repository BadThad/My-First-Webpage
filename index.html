    <h1>My Programming Journey</h1>
    
    <h3>Assignment 1</h3>
        <p>So I started off by downloading the wrong program. Instead of getting <strong>Visual Code</strong> 
            I downloaded <strong>Visual Studio</strong>, which obviously led to some initial confusion. I think
            I will have an easier time of getting to grips with HTML while Git will likely be a bit of a challenge
            for me. However, <em>practice makes perfect</em> so I'm confident that I'll get there in the end.

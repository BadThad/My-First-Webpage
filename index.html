        <p>So I started off by downloading the wrong program. Instead of getting <strong>Visual Code</strong> 
            I downloaded <strong>Visual Studio</strong>, which obviously led to some initial confusion. I think
            I will have an easier time of getting to grips with HTML while Git will likely be a bit of a challenge
            for me. However, <em>practice makes perfect</em> so I'm confident that I'll get there in the end.</p>

        <p>I started out by creating a branch, mostly to test it out and get some practice in. I then added 
            the <b>header</b> section and embedded the <b>nav</b> section within it. I also added <b>id tags</b>
            to different headers within the <b>main</b> section of the code and then referenced them to
            the list in the <b>nav</b> section.</p>

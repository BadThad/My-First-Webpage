        <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
        <p><em>In this section I will introduce myself a little bit and as time goes on I will add to it
            if I feel like it.</em></p>
        
        <p>My name is Peter FÃ¤nge but most people call me Pelle. In my free time I enjoy gaming on PC and 
            while I enjoy playing single-player games I often play together with friends. At the moment I am
            somewhat invested in an MMO called Guild Wars 2 which I have played for 2-3 years. I am also part
            of a group of about 25 people which plays a recurring Europa Universalis 4 campaign, and we're
            starting a new campaign next month which is really exciting!</p>
        <p>I also enjoy reading and I stick mostly to fantasy and sci-fi. When it comes to fantasy I am most fond
            of the works of Tolkien, but some of my other favourites include Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson and
            Terry Pratchett.
            With sci-fi it's more difficult to narrow it down but some of my favorite books are by the author
            Neal Stephenson. Other authors that top my list &#40 in the interest of keeping this list short,
            here are just a few& #41 are Orson Scott Card, Cixin Liu, Dan Simmons, and of course Arthur C. Clarke</p>
        <p>Another thing I thoroughly enjoy doing is spending time with my cat Winston.</p>

        <h3 id="assignment-1">Assignment 1</h3>
        <p>So I started off by downloading the wrong program. Instead of getting <strong>Visual Code</strong> 
            I downloaded <strong>Visual Studio</strong>, which obviously led to some initial confusion. I think
            I will have an easier time of getting to grips with HTML while Git will likely be a bit of a challenge
            for me. However, <em>practice makes perfect</em> so I'm confident that I'll get there in the end.</p>
        
        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <p>I have successfully pushed my changes to GitHub but the <em>images</em> folder is not showing 
            in the repository</p>

        <h4>What I'm Looking Forward to Learning</h4>
        <p>How to add media such as images and videos to a webpage.</p>
        <p>Becoming proficient &#40or at least sufficiently good&#41 at using Git.</p>
    
        <h3 id="assignment-2">Assignment 2</h3>
        <p>I started out by creating a branch, mostly to test it out and get some practice in. I figure I will
            create a branch every time I get a new assignment and then once I have recieved feedback and made
            changes I will merge them into the main branch. I proceeded by adding the <b>header</b> section 
            and embedded the <b>nav</b> section within it. I also added <b>id tags</b> to different headers 
            within the <b>main</b> section of the code and then referenced them to the list in 
            the <b>nav</b> section.</p>

        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <p>When I was writing the section <b>A Little About Me</b> I found that there is such a thing as
            the <b>sci-fi tag</b>. What does that tag do?</p>

        <h4>What I'm Looking Forward to Learning</h4>
        <p>How to make a drop-down list where I can list the assignments.</p>
        <p>Hot to make a sidebar for quick navigation and to offer some better structure to the page.</p>
